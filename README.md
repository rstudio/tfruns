Overview
--------

The **tfruns** package provides a suite of tools for managing TensorFlow training runs and experiments from R:

-   Track the hyperparameters, metrics, output, and source code of every training run.

-   Compare hyperparameters and metrics across runs to find the best performing model.

-   Automatically generate reports to visualize individual training runs or comparisons between runs.

-   No changes to source code required (run data is automatically captured for all Keras and TF Estimator models).

You can find documentation for the tfruns package at <https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tools/tfruns/>
